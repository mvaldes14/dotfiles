Perform a comprehensive review of my tasks in doit following productivity best practices. Use the doit MCP tools to gather data, then produce an actionable report.

## Data Collection

Call all of the following in parallel using MCP tools:

1. **All tasks** — `mcp__doit__list_tasks` — full task list for counts, status breakdown, and stale detection
2. **Today's tasks** — `mcp__doit__get_today_tasks` — what's due today
3. **Overdue tasks** — `mcp__doit__get_overdue_tasks` — past-due items
4. **Projects** — `mcp__doit__list_projects` — project list with task counts

## Analysis & Report

After collecting data, produce a structured report with these sections:

### 1. Daily Focus (Today)
- List today's tasks (from `/api/tasks/today`)
- Flag any overdue tasks with how many days overdue
- Assess if the day is overloaded (more than 5–7 tasks) or underloaded

### 2. Inbox Triage
- List tasks with no `project_id` (unorganized / inbox tasks)
- For each, suggest: assign to a project, add a due date, or delete
- Inbox should ideally be empty — it's a capture point, not a holding area

### 3. Status Hygiene
- Flag tasks stuck in `doing` for more than 3 days (stale in-progress)
- Flag tasks in `todo` with a past due date that haven't moved to `doing`
- Check for overuse of `doing` status (too many active tasks dilutes focus)

### 4. Stale & Overdue Tasks
- List all overdue tasks (from `/api/tasks/overdue`) sorted by how many days overdue
- For tasks overdue by more than 7 days, recommend: reschedule, or delete
- Flag `todo` tasks with no `due_date` that have been sitting untouched

### 5. Upcoming Week Preview
- Summarize task load per day for the next 7 days
- Flag days that are overloaded (more than 7 tasks)
- Flag days with zero tasks (opportunity to redistribute)

### 6. Project Health
- For each project (from `/api/projects`), report: total open tasks, tasks with due dates vs without
- Flag projects with more than 20 open tasks (may need breaking down)
- Flag projects with zero open tasks (completed or abandoned?)

### 7. Actionability Check
- Flag tasks with vague titles (single words, no verb, too generic)
- Good tasks start with a verb: "Write", "Fix", "Review", "Call", "Research"
- Suggest rewording for the top offenders

### 8. Completion Velocity
- Count tasks currently in `done` status
- Compare against total open tasks (todo + doing) — are you keeping up?
- Note any trends (all done tasks in one project? others neglected?)

## Output Format

Present the report as a clean markdown document with:
- A **TL;DR** at the top with 3–5 key takeaways
- Each section with counts and specific task titles/IDs
- A **Quick Wins** section at the bottom: 3–5 small actions to take right now to improve task hygiene
- Offer to help execute any recommended changes (reschedule via `mcp__doit__update_task`, delete via `mcp__doit__delete_task`)

## Save Report

After presenting the report in chat, save it to the Obsidian vault as a weekly review:

- **Path:** `Personal/weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (use the date of the Friday/end of the current week)
- Use the obsidian CLI:
  ```bash
  /usr/local/bin/obsidian create path="Personal/weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.md" content="..."
  ```
- Output the full file path after saving so it's easy to find

## Tone

Be direct and practical. This is a personal productivity review, not a corporate report. Call out what needs attention without being preachy.
